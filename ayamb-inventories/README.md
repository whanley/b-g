Realize that I didn't distinguish carefully between PT and PC (piastres tarif and piastres courante) when reading the documents.

I am breaking up the sequence of information as little as I can, but sometimes the date appears at the end of the entry. Can't back-generate the raw text string of each entry out of my corrected version, though it would be fairly close.
