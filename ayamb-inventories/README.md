Where type of £ (Stg. or Eg.) is unspecified, I'm calculating PT based on the Stg. rate (97.5). I'm doing this because in the summation prepared by Hewat, all 23 of the entries for £ alone (of a total of 117) were converted to PT on this basis. The errors that may result will be small.

Realize that I didn't distinguish carefully between PT and PC (piastres tarif and piastres courante) when reading the documents.

I am breaking up the sequence of information as little as I can, but sometimes the date appears at the end of the entry. Can't back-generate the raw text string of each entry out of my corrected version, though it would be fairly close.
